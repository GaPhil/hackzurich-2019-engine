Interviewer: Please tell us more about your recent experiences. 
Candidate: I am a full stack java developer. So basically I can do anything from front end stuff, 
to backend, including databases, cicd, stuff like that. 
Interviewer: The job requires some of that, but the backend is based on nodejs. Is that a problem?
Candidate: No, that's actually the direction I was developing myself over the last 2 years. 
Interviewer: Specifically, what did you use it for? Your last job, at the logistics company, it says
here you worked primarily on java-based backend, and an oracle database, exadata, is that right?
nodejs. 
Candidate: It's correct, but I contribute towards open source in my spare time, and thats mostly nodejs. 
Interviewer: Thats interesting, which project do you contribute for?
Candidate: Wey. It's a bit like Slack, just open source. Early stages, I'd say. 
Interviewer: And about databases? We are getting rid of Oracle, slowly but surely, and are more interested
in someone with redshift and athena.
Candidate: No, I haven't really worked with either yet. I am familiar with Mongo, MySql and Postgres though. 
Interviewer: When did you use those? We use those as well, here and there. 
Candidate: I use mongo all the time for my personal projects. I used MySQL and Progres on my previous job. 
Interviewer: When was that?
Candidate: 2015. 
Interviewer: Would you consider yourself proficient with it? I have to warn you, our legacy stack is a bit
complex and we are looking for someone with exprience.
Candidate: I'd not call myself super experienced but I think I am fairly profficient. I've been using it for 
a few years, and honestly, I think when it comes to SQL I am quite good. It is not that different between 
Oracle and MySQL, really.
