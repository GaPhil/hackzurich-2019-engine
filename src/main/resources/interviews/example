Interviewer: You mentioned you have experience with scripting languages. Can you
tell us a bit more about your experience with Python?
Candidate: I have used Python for years now. Primarily for ad-hoc scripting, nothing too
major, not large, monolithic applications.
Interviewer: That's great. Are you familiar with the microservice design patterns?
Candidate: Yes, I have a little experience. In my previous jobs we were using Oracle's
Kubernetes Engine.
Interviewer: Thanks. That's what we are using here as well. And how about Azure?
Candidate: I haven't used it, no. Unless office365 counts, I've used that a lot in my last job.
Interviewer: And how about AWS Lambda?
Candidate: I'd really like to learn it. Haven't used it yet.
Interviewer: And GCP Cloud Functions?
Candidate: I am sorry, no, I don't have much experience with GCP either.
