- Do you have any people management experience?
- Really depends on what you mean by that. I have been an architect, lead developer, also a product owner over the 
last decade. All of those roles involved managing - in this way or another - developers, testers, etc.
- To be specific, were you responsible for hiring, career development. Direct reportees. 
- Yes, I had developers reporting to me on a number of projects.
- How large were the teams? 
- Medium sized, I'd say. Usually around a dozen individuals. Developers and testers mostly. I have to say, 
I am not looking for people management roles. I assume this is an architect's position, yes?
- That is correct, but we do have people reporting to that role. Mostly analysts and senior developers currently. Do you
feel comfortable with managing people?
- Yes, although that is not my preference on this job. The job description did not mention people management, honestly
I think it might not be the best match for me.
