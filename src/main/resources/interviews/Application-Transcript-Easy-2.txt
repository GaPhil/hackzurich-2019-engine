eeeh I see a red dot now, so I assume the video is recording.
Hi there, my name is Alissa and I am applying for the job of Scrum Master you advertised on Linkedin.
It's really weird to talk to a camera like this but anyhow! Eeeem, scrum master, yes, I would like to
apply for that job as I have the right experience and skills for it. I currently work as systems analyst
in a product team. We do 3 week sprints and we use Jira to manage the backlog and the user stories. When
the scrum master is not there I take over and run the sprints. During the summer I ran 3 sprints as scrum master
for the team and we delivered all user stories on time. For documentation we use confluence.
I want to become a scrum master because I think I'm very good at it, I understand Jira well and I am not afraid
to chase the team and the product owner to write good user stories and story points. The team often gives me compliments
on the structure I bring to the overall Agile process.
Next to Jira and Agile I have a lot of experience with all the Google G-suite tools like Sheets and Slides and Drive. I maintain
the shared drive of the team and ensure everything is there, has the right names and is up to date.
I hope you will consider me for the job, I would love to come for a face to face interview to explain more. 
I hope to speak to you soon, bye!
