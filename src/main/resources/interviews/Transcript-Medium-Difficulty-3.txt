Interviewer: Thanks for that! Lets start with some questions about your skills, shall we?
Candidate: Sure, what do you want to know?
Interviewer: Your CV mentions you have experience with low level kernel development in windows. 
As you know, we are looking for an engineer to help us with the drivers for a hardware product 
we are developing. Mostly low level stuff but also quite a bit of higher level windows programming,
creating installation packages, stuff like that. How comfortable are you with that kind of work?
Candidate: Pretty confident, thats what I did for the last few years. 
Interviewer: Can you give us some specifics?
Candidate: My current job involves creating plug and play stack drivers for computer peripherials.
Mice and keyboards mostly, rgb illumination, fans. My role was to create low level code that
talks to the hardware devices, via windows kernel APIs, interrupts and ports, and exposes
the functionalities to the rest of the operating system. 
Candidate: Mostly Microsoft Assem
Interviewer: I see. What technologies did you use?
Candidate: MASM, thats Microsoft Assembler, and Microsoft C++. Visual studio. I also used 
vmware and ida. 
Interviewer: IDA?
Candidate: Sorry, that's Interactive Disassembler. 
Interviewer: Thanks, thats very useful. Our engineers here use the same toolkit. Did you 
also participate in making installation packages and so on?
Candidate: No, not really. I did testing, but producing windows install packages, end 
user tools and so on wasn't my thing. My main responsibility is the low level interface 
development work, that's my specialty.
