Through this video I would like to apply for the job of Senior Business analyst at your company.
My name is John Edwards and I'm currently employed at AllUCanEat food delivery service as business analyst, 
but I'm considering changing jobs.
In my job as business analyst I work with lots of systems every day. I have working experience
with Microsoft Office 365, I consider myself an expert in Excel. I create lots of weekly and
monthly Excel reports for the CEO of AllUCanEat. I create my reports by using SQL server to extract tables 
from our order database and with some Excel Macro's I integrate the data into reports for the CEO and his team.
For planning I use Microsoft Project to ensure I deliver my work on time and within scope. 
In my spare time im doing a Machine Learning course at Udemy, Im hoping to finish this next year.
Furthermore I have experience with Access databases and used a lot of SQL during my time at university.
I'm hoping you can consider me for this position. I could star as early as December 1st.
Thanks and bye bye.
