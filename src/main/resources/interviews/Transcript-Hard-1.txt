- Okay, thanks for that, very good to know. how about other frameworks?
- I used dialogflow. it's google's nlp engine. i was lead dev for a project that built a chatbot on top of it. 
- When was that?
- That's recent. that's my current job. 
- What's your role on the team?
- I am lead dev for the integration between dialogflow and our own backend. The chatbot answers 
both generic and specific questions. You can ask it when the installation team will come to connect
your wifi, and the thing checks your current case, your address, and so on. There is integration in place
to facilitate that. That was my main role. To design that. 
- Thats very relevant. We use Lex, not Dialogflow, but I think when it comes to integration work your 
experience will be very relevant. Do you happen to have any exprience with Lex?
- To be honest not really. Someone else did the comparison and they decided we will go with dialogflow,
and I sort of didn't get involved in Lex evaluation. I know Lex exists, thats about it. I'd not say 
I am not interested to learn, but haven't any practical experience yet. 
- And on your chatbot, did you also help train the NLP parser and design the flow of the conversations?
- Yeah, about that, that wasn't really my role. I was building APIs Dialogflow would use to retrieve
information, but other people set up training phrases and trained the engine to recognize what people say. 
- Was your role strictly limited to this?
- No, I was also involved in end to end testing. I also developed the CICD pipeline for the team. 
- What did you use for that?
- Most of our work is hosted in gcp, we used kubernetes, and a bit of cloud functions, 
- ...and for ci/cd specifically?
- cloud build for some, we also used spinnaker and gke 
- ...
- google kubernetes engine. thats how they call it. 
- thank you! thats very useful
