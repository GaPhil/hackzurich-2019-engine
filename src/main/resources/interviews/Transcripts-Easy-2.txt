Interviewer: We need someone to help us with testing automation. 
Candidate: You mean, like application testing? Or code testing?
Interviewer: We have a multichannel app, it's both web and mobile. We use Selenium to automate
some test cases. Are you familiar with it?
Candidate: Yes, I have used Selenium. 
Interviewer: Can you tell us a bit more?
Candidate: I have been using Selenium for web scraping. 
I also know Puppeteer, but I am less familiar with it. 
Interviewer: The next question might be a bit surprising, but do you happen to know 
visual basic.net?
Candidate: For web testing?
Interviewer: We have a piece of code that was written a few years ago, it combines test reports
and generates some XLS reports. 
Candidate: Uhm, I am not really familiar with vb.net, to be honest. It's not something I'd 
particularly like to learn either.
