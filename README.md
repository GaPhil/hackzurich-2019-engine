### Challenge

Wouldn’t it be nice if working with recruitment firms was easier and more efficient for candidates? We all have CV’s, but we can’t have our life story on them else no one would read them. So you spend your time interviewing to give a fuller picture. However where there are humans, there is human error. Maybe the recruiter doesn’t update your file correctly, or misunderstands something and you have no chance to correct them after the interview.

The opportunity here is to create something that currently doesn’t exist. Use NLP tools to improve the chances of your interview landing you a relevant job, and quicker. Lots of information is exchanged between candidates and recruiters. This data, if well structured and accurate, can be very valuable. This is not an easy task, but if successful, you will improve the job search of every candidate we come across, including you. We will provide you with what you need to get going from the recruitment side, then together, we have the opportunity to change the world of recruitment for the better, forever. Data and NLP are already changing the face of many industries. Let’s shake up recruitment. It needs it.
